    "In the previous notebooks, we have discussed [Time Series Analysis with Python](https://www.kaggle.com/prashant111/complete-guide-on-time-series-analysis-in-python) and [ARIMA Model for Time Series Forecasting](https://www.kaggle.com/prashant111/arima-model-for-time-series-forecasting). In this notebook, we will make a time series forecast using Facebook’s time series model [Prophet](https://facebook.github.io/prophet/). First up, we will discuss [Prophet](https://facebook.github.io/prophet/),  its advantages and make a time series forecast with [Prophet](https://facebook.github.io/prophet/).\n",

    "   *Prophet is a procedure for forecasting time series data based on an additive model where non-linear trends are fit with yearly, weekly, and daily seasonality, plus holiday effects. It works best with time series that have strong seasonal effects and several seasons of historical data. Prophet is robust to missing data and shifts in the trend, and typically handles outliers well.*\n",
